							<h2>Profile</h2>
							<p>
								Rohit Gurunath Sharma (born 30 April 1987) is an Indian international 
								cricketer who plays for Mumbai in domestic cricket and captains Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier 
								League as a right-handed batsman and an occasional right-arm off break bowler. He is the vice-captain of the
								 Indian national team in limited-overs formats.
								
							</p><p>
								Talent â€“ an apparently heartening term that has followed Rohit Sharma around like a shadow; 
								even haunted him at times. It seems to be a burden that the cricketing fraternity has enforced upon him and, 
								after more than a decade in the national setting, he has been weighed down by the label.
							</p>
							<p>
								It all began after an injury to an in-form Yuvraj Singh in the 2007 World T20, 
								when Rohit was called upon as a last-minute emergency replacement to play a league game against the hosts.
								 After a lacklustre start to the Indian innings, the 20-year-old strode out into Kingsmead and stroked his way to a fluent 
								 half-century against the likes of Pollock, Ntini and Morkel as though he were having a net session. 
								 He showed startling maturity under pressure to survive till the end of the innings, escorting India to a 
								 respectable total that they ultimately defended,
								 knocking South Africa out of the tournament in their own backyard.
								</p>
								<p>
									Rohit was subsequently picked for the ODI team on a selection whim after his burst of vital performances 
									in the World T20 and his impressive Ranji Trophy record. He made an impression in the CB series Down Under, 
									playing some crucial cameos against stalwarts like Brett Lee and Stuart Clark, and a more-than-competent Sri Lankan attack. 
									These inspired away performances in the World T20 and the CB series caught the eye of the selectors, 
									and warranted him an extended run with the limited-overs side
								</p>
								<p>
									With Ajinkya Rahane, one of the most complete batsmen in the side, breathing down his neck, 
									Rohit Sharma must be swift in grabbing his Test opportunities, or he could soon find himself on the bench. 
									His ODI performance, nonetheless, has been improving by leaps and bounds, as he caps off a laudable 2017 with 
									1293 runs and 6 centuries. A more technically sound batsman now, Rohit has shown improvement against the red ball with 
									better awareness of his off-stump, a more compact technique, and a higher degree of patience. However, unless he is able to 
									convert his ability into overseas runs, 
									his tale will continue to be one that makes you ponder what could have been.
								</p>
								<h2>IPL through the years</h2>
								<p>
									The IPL has done a lot for Rohit Sharma. When he was a young, talented batsman who struggled with consistency, 
									the IPL gave him a ticket to stay relevant, and he grabbed it with both hands during his time with the Deccan Chargers 
									from 2008-2010, scoring over 350 runs in each of the three seasons. Then the IPL took him back to his home of Mumbai, 
									and Rohit couldn't have been happier. His statistics with the Mumbai Indians got progressively better from 2011-13, 
									and eventually his best IPL season in 2013 - 
									where he finished the tournament with 538 runs - coincided with MI's maiden title win.

								</p>
								<p>
									And finally, the IPL helped unveil a leadership side to Rohit Sharma that has impressed a lot of people. 
									In six years as captain, Rohit has led MI to three IPL titles which is an amazing accomplishment.
									 Rohit is among the all-time top run-scorers in the IPL, only behind Suresh Raina and Virat Kohli.
									  He is the most successful IPL captain, along with MS Dhoni, with three titles. 
									And he has 34 IPL fifties, just two behind the top-most number held by David Warner and Gautam Gambhir.
								</p>
								<h2>World Cup through the years</h2>
								<p>
									India's right-handed opener, one who established himself a little
									 late his career at the top of the order, has become a vital cog in India's limited-overs set-up,
									  particularly after his spectacular performances in Australia in the limited-overs series in early 2016. 
									  The only man to score three double-hundreds in ODIs was a plaudit that exhibited remarkable talent, 
									  but not consistency. Sharma, however, has changed that in the last few years, at least in the white-ball game,
									   and goes into the 2019 World Cup as the World's second-ranked batsman after his captain. His record in the one World Cup 
									   he has been a part of - 2015 - has been excellent, with 330 runs in 8 innings, including 2 fifties and a hundred, at an a
									   verage of 47.14. Even between the 2015 edition and the 2019 edition, Sharma has evolved as a batsman and will certainly 
									   play a major role if India are to compete for the cricket world's most coveted trophy.
